## How to run Bash-Scripting files

### Set permissions
Inside your CLI you will want to give permission to all shell files inside our directory at once before attempting to run code in each file. Give the permission setting of 755 to our directory by entering the code below:
```
chmod -R 755 bash-scripting
```

OPTIONAL: You may choose to give permissions to files one at a time by using the code below:
```
$ chmod 755 <filename>
```

### Run programs
The following are the type of commands you can enter for ch2_1.sh & separately for ch2_2.sh (read files to get a hint on how to utilize code):
```
$ ./ch2_1.sh buona sera
// STDOUT should show here if successful

$./ch2_2.sh
// STDOUT should show here if successful
```
