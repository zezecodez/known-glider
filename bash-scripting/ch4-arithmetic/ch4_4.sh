# 4. Now let's play with the previous script. Modify it so that you can specify as a command line argument the upper limit of the random number. Can you make it so that a lower limit can be specified also? eg. if I ran ./random.sh 10 45 it would only return random numbers between 10 and 45.

let min=$1
let max=$2-$1+1
expr $min + $RANDOM % $max
