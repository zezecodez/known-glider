echo "FRom faireſt creatures we deſire increaſe, That thereby beauties Roſe might neuer die, But as the riper ſhould by time deceaſe, His tender heire might beare his memory: But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes, Feed’ſt thy lights flame with ſelfe ſubſtantiall fewell, Making a famine where aboundance lies, Thy ſelfe thy foe,to thy ſweet ſelfe too cruell: Thou that art now the worlds freſh ornament, And only herauld to the gaudy ſpring, Within thine owne bud burieſt thy content, And tender chorle makſt waſt in niggarding: Pitty the world,or elſe this glutton be, To eate the worlds due,by the graue and thee." > sonnet_1_complete.txt
